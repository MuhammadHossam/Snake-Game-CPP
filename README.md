# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game Example

This is a starter repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

The Capstone Project gives you a chance to integrate what you've learned throughout this program. This project will become an important part of your portfolio to share with current and future colleagues and employers.

In this project, you can build your own C++ application or extend this Snake game, following the principles you have learned throughout this Nanodegree Program. This project will demonstrate that you can independently create applications using a wide range of C++ features.

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 3.7
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* SDL2 >= 2.0
  * All installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation)
  >Note that for Linux, an `apt` or `apt-get` installation is preferred to building from source. 
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./SnakeGame`.


## Game New Features
1. Multiplier game with two snakes (Note that this is done by two child threads that run asynchronously) one is controlled by (Right, left, up, and down buttons) and the second controller is controlled by (d, a, w, and s).  (Note that buttons can be configured easily in the game constructor). TO BE CONFIGURED FROM CONFIGURATION TEXT FILE SOON.....
2. Poison food is added to freeze the snake for 3 seconds to give the privilege to the second player to win more points.
3. Shrinking food is added to decrement the snake size and also the player score till the snake dies if size becomes zero.
4. The highest score is restored from a text file in the project folder and after the game is finalized, if the winner score is higher than the highest score, then the file will be updated with new score. (Note that this done by abstraction methodology through new classes with APIs)
5. The two players will lose if the two snakes hit each other. 
6. Game can be paused by escape button.
